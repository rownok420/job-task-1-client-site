## About Project

- I've used react to develop the UI of this site.
- This is a Information related website and mainly focused on get user information.
- I have used font-awesome for icons. And also used react-bootstrap for responsiveness and faster design.
- I have also used react-router-dom.
- This site is dynamic. I have used mongodb, nodejs and heroku to get dynamic data for website and loaded data from mongodb to show in the UI.
